Roger          	> Mango gives him sense that his future could be different than how he perceived it
Borden sisters 	> She is forgiving of them. Understands their desire to prolong the moment, but more who they were at the moment
Wanda          	> Shift to how other people treat them and allows them an imagined life.
Mr. Gilman     	> Are people treting him differentlu or does he just believe they are?

What people are carrying - People become anonymous.

	- Wears his wife's nightgown when home alone. Does this in the privacy of his own bedroom.

Different types of costumes.
Different types of spaces we want to wear them.

"Cycles of consolation and enhancment"
	- throughout the story people are consoled or enhanced by the costumes they wear.
		- Wanda is consoled by people thinking that she has a baby.
		- Woman with the pacemaker enhanced. She feels younger. 
	- Becoming more (and also less) than what it really is.
		> That this costuming is making us more, but is also dimishing our real identity. 
		> We have to stop wearing costumes.
		> Narrative that's created by the wearing of a costume. 
		> Two-pronged identity: We both create our own narrative and others create our narrative.

Person's ability to re-create him/herself through various forms of artifice.
Clothing/props covers up as much as they reveals.
	- Analogy for narratives/stories.
We also use storries/narratives as a way to "dress up" for the "carnival of life"
We are just life these people. We all wear costumes and perform our identity
	- We als have multiple different costumes/identities
Narrator ends stories early because we never see al of someone's life while passing on the street, etc. 
	- We only get a part of people's narratives. 
Identity as a fluid, shifting construct.
