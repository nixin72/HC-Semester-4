EVERYONE HAS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS OPINION
	- The majority of our decisions are made unconsciously
	- Patterns determine thought process

	- Brains catagorize people on the basis of their age, weight, skin color, social status, accent, etc...
	- Most of us have unconscious biases against people outside our group
