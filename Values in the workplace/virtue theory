Both utilitarian and Kantian ethics:

	- See humans as interchangable. It doesn't matter who is involved. 
	- Ignore relationships, personal commitments, etc.
	
Virtue Theory - Aristotle:
	- Geocentric
	- Planets moved in perfect circles with uniform motion.
	- TELEOLOGICAL: goal directed
	- A thing's purpose --> it's real nature --> virtue/excellence
	
Purposes: 
	-Plants: 
		- Grow
		- reproduce
		- CO2, O2
		- Take nourish
	- Animals:
		- ""
		- Move 
		- Sense
	- Humans: 
		- ""
		- think/reason
		- Practical reason means-ends
		- Theoretical reasoning concepts (Justice, triangles, etc.)
	So the function of a human being is to reason well.
	Our primary function is NOT pleasure, but pleasure is an element of a good life, as is friendship.
	External goods: Money, power, education - these aren't essential to living a good life, but they help. 
	
Intrinsic value: Flourishing
	Virtue: Is a state of character
		- Habits, thoughs, beliefs, desires, actions
		- Living an auhentic life 
	A matter of choice - your passions and your desires are all under your control. 
		- You can fake it until it becomes natural
		- Extremely difficult to do this. 
	Lying in a mean - between extremes
		- Deficit: Cowardly, impatience, indifference, hateful
		- Virtue: Courage, patience, compassion, kindness
		- Excess: Rash, inactive/lazy/pushover, obssessive, obsequious
	Relative to the situatation - NOT RELATIVISM
		- What is virtue in one situation can be a vice in another
	We can determine virtue through a rationeal principle
		- not intuition
		- Not chance
	==> A thoughtful process <==
	
	Your life has purpose: You choose. 
	To err is human, we aren't perfect 
		- We must strive always to be better
		
The good life: 
	1. The individual
		- Goods of the body (health, fitness, beauty)
		- Goods of the soul (intellect, charm, virue)
	2. Social context
		- Training		- Wealth
		- Power			- Civil status
	3. The interplay between 1 & 2
Ethical behavior = being a good person 
	1. thoughtful
		- practical reason, know the relevant facts
	2. A virtuous person wants to be virtuous.
		- Not based in self-interest
	3. Perform the right action for the right reason and the right duration
		- eg. "Good" anger 

Pop cuture's "good man": 
	- rich			- Handsome		- respectful
	- strong		- Powerful		- Intelligent
	- confident		- Sucess		- Generous
	- Noble			- gentleman		- Leader

Benefits of virtue
	- Theory:
		- Always growth, change
		- Grounded in reality, not abstract concepts
		- Allows for importance of personal commitments, values, emotions
		- Importance of balance
		- "Of seeing one's life as purposeful, work of art"
		- Importance of relationships, others flourishing

Problems: 
	- not clear
	- No rules or instructions to determine what is right 
	- What to do when goods aren't available: Sick, poor, racist
	- How do we reconcile individual difference
